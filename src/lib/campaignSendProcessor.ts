/**
 * Resumable campaign sending.
 *
 * Replaces the old approach of sending every approved carrier in a single
 * synchronous loop inside the admin's HTTP request — that leaned on
 * Vercel's execution-time limit by design (a campaign with several
 * carriers, each with a large recipient list, could take minutes, all
 * inside one request the admin's browser was waiting on).
 *
 * Instead: each call to processNextCampaignBatch() does AT MOST one
 * carrier's worth of sending, then either triggers the next carrier via a
 * fresh serverless invocation (see triggerNextBatch) or finalizes the
 * campaign if that was the last one. "Which carriers are already done" is
 * derived from which carriers already have a CampaignCarrierBatch row for
 * this campaign — no separate progress column needed, and it's exactly
 * what makes this resumable: calling this function again for a
 * campaign that's already partway done just picks up the next
 * unprocessed carrier, whether that's the normal next hop in the chain or
 * a recovery sweep picking up a stalled one.
 *
 * Callers: the approve route (first carrier, via after()), the internal
 * continuation route (every subsequent carrier), and the recovery cron
 * (any campaign whose chain appears to have stalled).

/**
 * Shared "approve and begin sending" logic — the single source of truth

 * extracted rather than duplicated: this is exactly the kind of atomic
 * claim-guarded-on-status logic that's caused real races elsewhere in
 * this codebase when written twice (see the wallet-balance reservation
 * fix), and a divergence here specifically could mean a campaign gets
 * approved-and-sent twice, or sent despite failing its own status check.
 *
 * Does NOT call after() itself — Next.js's after() needs to be invoked
 * directly within a route handler's own execution to correctly attach to
 * that request's lifecycle, not from a few layers of awaited helper
 * functions deep. Callers get back whether to schedule the send and with
 * what campaignId, and call after() themselves.
 *
 * auditActorId is separate from reviewedByAdminId: a human approval sets
 * both to the same admin's id. An auto-approval (message cleared every
 * NCC hard-fail check, no human involved) sets reviewedByAdminId to null
 * and auditActorId to null too — AdminAuditLog.adminId is a required,
 * non-nullable foreign key to a real User, and there IS no user to
 * attribute a system decision to, so the audit log entry is skipped
 * entirely for that case rather than attributing it to an arbitrary
 * admin who didn't make the call. Campaign.autoApproved is the durable
 * record of what happened instead (see prisma/schema.prisma).
