/**
 * Validates environment variables at process startup, not deep inside
 * whatever request happens to touch a missing one first.
 *
 * Wired in via src/instrumentation.ts, which Next.js runs once when the
 * server process boots (before it starts serving requests) — see
 * https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation
 *
 * Two tiers, not one:
 *  - REQUIRED_VARS: the app cannot serve a single page without these
 *    (DB connection, Supabase auth). Missing one of these means nothing
 *    works, so we crash the boot loudly rather than let every request fail
 *    mysteriously.
 *  - RECOMMENDED_VARS: needed for specific features (sending SMS, wallet
 *    top-ups) but the rest of the app — signup, dashboard, browsing —
 *    works fine without them. Crashing local dev because Paystack isn't
 *    configured yet is worse than the problem it solves, so these only
 *    warn. The warning still fires at boot, so it's still "found out
 *    immediately," just not "server refuses to start."
 *
 * Deliberately NOT imported by every route — importing it once from
 * instrumentation.ts is what makes this "checked at boot" instead of
 * "fails on first request that needs the var."
