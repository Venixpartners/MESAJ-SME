/**
 * Shared request rate limiting.
 *
 * Why Postgres and not in-memory: this app runs as serverless functions
 * (Vercel), where each invocation can land on a different, ephemeral
 * instance — an in-memory counter would only ever limit requests that
 * happen to hit the same warm instance, which isn't a real limit at all
 * under actual traffic. There's no Redis/Upstash in this stack yet, and
 * Postgres is already the durable store everything else uses, so a
 * fixed-window counter table there is the correct choice without adding
 * new infra. See RateLimitHit in prisma/schema.prisma.
 *
 * Fixed window, not sliding: a client can send up to `limit` requests near
 * the end of one window and another `limit` near the start of the next
 * (worst case ~2x limit over a short span). That's an accepted tradeoff for
 * simplicity — every route calling this is guarding against sustained abuse
 * (credential stuffing, submit-spam, hammering the Mesaj API), not
 * enforcing an exact quota, so the boundary edge case doesn't matter here.
 * Revisit with a sliding-window or token-bucket approach if that changes.
