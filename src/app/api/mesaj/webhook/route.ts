/**
 * POST /api/mesaj/webhook
 *
 * Mesaj is our single direct upstream client relationship — every tenant's
 * traffic goes through our one MESAJ_API_TOKEN, so this is the one shared
 * webhook URL for delivery events across ALL tenants. Attribution back to
 * the right tenant/campaign happens entirely through the MessageRecipient
 * row we created at send time (see lib/messageRecipients.ts), matched here
 * by `mesajReference` — never trust anything in this payload to say which
 * tenant it belongs to.
 *
 * Sample payload (confirmed from Mesaj, 2026-07-28):
 * {
 *   "data": {
 *     "error": null, "amount": 5.5, "status": "DELIVERED",
 *     "message": "...", "clientId": "...", "errorCode": "",
 *     "messageId": "...",      // NOT unique per recipient — shared across
 *                               // an entire send request, do not match on this
 *     "recipient": "2349060594869",
 *     "reference": "...",      // per-recipient — this is what we match on
 *     "shortCode": "TURNAJFLEX",
 *     "dateTimeSent": 1761152074735,
 *     "errorMessage": "",
 *     "transactionId": "...",  // observed identical to `reference` so far
 *     "dateTimeFailed": null,
 *     "dateTimeDelivered": 1761135881000
 *   },
 *   "event": "SMS_DELIVERED",
 *   "timestamp": "..."
 * }
 *
 * Configure this URL with Mesaj as your delivery-report webhook endpoint.
