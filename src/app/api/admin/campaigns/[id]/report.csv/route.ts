/**
 * GET /api/admin/campaigns/[id]/report.csv
 *
 * Admin's counterpart to /api/campaigns/[id]/report.csv, but the other
 * way round on the gate: the client-facing one requires reportApprovedAt
 * to be set (clients only ever see an approved report), while THIS one
 * deliberately has no such check — the whole point is letting admin
 * download and review the report BEFORE deciding whether to approve it
 * (see the "Delivery report approval" queue this is called from). Only
 * requires the campaign to have actually been sent — before that there's
 * no delivery data to export yet.
 *
 * Same CSV shape as the client export (MSISDN, Telco, Status) so a report
 * downloaded here and one downloaded later by the client after approval
 * are identical, byte for byte.
