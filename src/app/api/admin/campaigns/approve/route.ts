/**
 * POST /api/admin/campaigns/approve
 * Body: { campaignId: string }
 *
 * Admin-only. Approves a campaign, then hands sending off to a background
 * chain (see lib/campaignSendProcessor.ts) instead of sending
 * synchronously inside this request.
 *
 * Why: the old version looped over every approved carrier and awaited
 * each Mesaj call in this same request — meaning a campaign with several
 * carriers, each with a large recipient list, could take minutes, all
 * inside one HTTP request the admin's browser was blocked on, leaning on
 * Vercel's execution-time limit by design rather than by architecture.
 *
 * Now: this route only validates, atomically claims the campaign as
 * APPROVED, and schedules the first carrier's send via after() — which
 * runs after this response is already sent, so the admin's request
 * returns immediately. That first hop then triggers the next carrier as
 * its own fresh serverless invocation, and so on, until every carrier is
 * done, at which point the campaign is finalized (SENT/FAILED, refund,
 * client notification) — see lib/campaignSendProcessor.ts for the full
 * chain and lib/campaignSendFailure equivalent handling.
 *
 * The response here is now "approved and sending", not "sent" — the
 * admin UI (CampaignQueue.tsx) already only checks res.ok, it doesn't
 * inspect send results, so no further UI change was needed beyond the
 * toast copy.
